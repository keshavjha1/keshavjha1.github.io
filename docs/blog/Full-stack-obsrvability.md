# Full stack observability 
FSO at cisco is defined by three primary pillars: visibility, insights, and actions. Our further understanding of the landscape is as follows:

Our approach to Full-Stack Observability builds on continuous and tightly integrated monitoring.
We provide Visibility, Insights and Actions across the Full Stack, from the API all the way to the bare metal, across all data types.
We do this for traditional and cloud native applications and across hybrid and multi cloud environments.
We acknowledge that 95% of our customers have a mix of the traditional and cloud native apps and we support these use cases.
We tie our insights back to the business context: customers can know there is a problem, why the problem occurred and what to tackle immediately.
We help optimize for performance, cost, security, and environmental impact (carbon intensity).
